# flexpath-async-programming-with-js-exercises

## [Getting Started]

- include gifs here
- Include relevant steps to run exercise files or start the app
- "Open the file located at exercise-repo-name/whatever in VS Code"

- Also, include instructions on how to open their terminal in 

- WHILE DOING THIS, LOOK OUT FOR ANY POTENTIAL WINDOWS FILE PATH ISSUES in exercises


## Exercise overview

Give quick overview about context of exercises and their intention


## Specific exercises listed in numbered order

Add disclaimer if exercises are stored inside of specific files as comments

Also, for a plain text reference, theres always the `EXERCISE-INSTRUCTIONS` files to pop open

To answer questions that don't require coding, please create a file in the repo named 
[exercise_number_answer].txt.

For example, if in one of the exercise repos question 13 just asked a question to explain a programming concept, store your answer inside of a new file named exercise_13_answer.txt.

## Testing / Verification

Include relevant details here about where solution files are stored

### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Asynchronous Programming**:
    
    - Understanding the differences between synchronous and asynchronous code execution.
    - Working with callbacks and the challenges they present, such as the callback pyramid of doom.
2. **Promises**:
    
    - Creating and using Promises in JavaScript.
    - Promise states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
    - Consuming promises using `then`, `catch`, and `finally` methods.
    - Chaining multiple promises for sequential execution.
    - Handling errors and understanding how promises handle rejected states.
    - Using Promise-based libraries like Axios.
3. **Async/Await**:
    
    - Simplifying asynchronous code using the `async` and `await` keywords.
    - Error handling in async functions using try-catch blocks.
    - Using async/await for sequential and parallel API requests.
    - Combining promises and async/await for more complex asynchronous flows.
4. **Advanced Promise Methods**:
    
    - `Promise.all`: Running multiple promises concurrently and waiting for all to complete.
    - `Promise.allSettled`: Handling all promises and capturing both resolved and rejected outcomes.
    - `Promise.any`: Returning the first resolved promise and handling multiple sources of data.
    - `Promise.race`: Handling the first settled promise, whether fulfilled or rejected.
5. **HTTP Requests**:
    
    - Making HTTP requests using `XMLHttpRequest` and Fetch API.
    - Handling and configuring HTTP headers and status codes.
    - Using AbortController to cancel requests.
    - Understanding CORS and preflight requests.
